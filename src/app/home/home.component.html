        Hey! I'm Gonzalo, a Chilean Informatics Civil Engineer currently living and studying a 
        Master's degree in Computer Science in Passau, Germany.
        As of right now, I'm in the last semester of the degree, writing my Master's thesis about
        the implementation of a Graph-Based object input synthesis heuristic for a better automatic 
        generation of unit tests for Python. Even thought it might not be so obvious considering my previous
        professional experiences, something I am passionate about is data visualization and how it can help
        have a better understanding of already processed raw data. Besides trying to finish my degree,
        I find myself on the look for a new job oportunity, either as a Data Analyst or a Front-end/Back-end Engineer.
