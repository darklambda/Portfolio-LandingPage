        Hey! I'm Gonzalo, a Chilean Informatics Civil Engineer, currently living and studying a Master's degree in Computer Science in Passau, Germany. As of right now, I'm in the last semester of the degree, writing my Master's thesis about the implementation of a Graph-Based object input synthesis heuristic for a better automatic generation of unit tests for Python. Even thought it might not be so obvious considering my previous professional experiences, something I'm passionate about is data visualization and how it can help have a better understanding of already processed raw data. Besides trying to finish my degree, I find myself on the look for a new job opportunity, either as a Data Analyst or a Front-end/Back-end Engineer.
