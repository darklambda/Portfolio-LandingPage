# Portfolio LandingPage

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/darklambda/Portfolio-LandingPage/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.2, with the idea of it being the first approach to any of my personal projects.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Notes
Some views might need you to download an run locally other repositories from my Github site in order to work properly.
